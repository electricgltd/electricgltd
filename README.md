## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**electricgltd/electricgltd** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a low code monkey, endevouring to escape the day to day electrical contracting business I run.
I've been using copilot studio to automate the back office, and am taking it a step further and adding GitHub into the mix to keep track of things. It's interesting realising how the dev world influences the functionality of the products.
